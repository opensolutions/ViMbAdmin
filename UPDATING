Specific Update Notes
======================

Upgrading from 0.1.2 and below to 2.0 and above
------------------------------------------------

In application.ini:

1) rename "likeForLikeAliases" to "mailboxAliases"
2) add new option "defaults.table.entries" and set it to one of 10, 25, 50, 100







Updating In General
===================

As we distribute the configuration file as application.ini.dist, you should
be able to unpack new versions directly over older versions bearing 
specific notes below in mind.

Also ensure to chown / chmod the var/ directory if its ownership changes.

There is an example below.






Examples
========

Example 1
==========

In your current directory, you have a live version of vimbadmin V0.1.2 in the 
directory: vimbadmin
 
To install vimbadmin-0.2.2, you might start by downloading it:

http://vimbadmin.googlecode.com/files/vimbadmin-0.2.2.tar.gz

Then change directory to:

cd vimbadmin

And replace current files with new version:

tar zxvf ../vimbadmin-0.2.2.tar.gz --strip=1 

This command unpacks the new release striping the leading directory name 
(which we always append with the version: vimbadmin-0.2.2) over the
current one.

As we distribute the configuration as .dist, it will not replace your existing
configured.

IMPORTANT: make sure you check specific upgrade notes above to see if they
apply to you!

Example 2
==========


In your current directory, you have a live version of vimbadmin V0.1.2 in the 
directory: vimbadmin-0.1.2.

This is symlinked as followings:

vimbadmin -> vimbadmin-0.1.2

and Apache uses vimbadmin in its configuration.
 
To install vimbadmin-0.2.2, you might:

http://vimbadmin.googlecode.com/files/vimbadmin-0.2.2.tar.gz

and then extract it with:

tar zxf vimbadmin-0.2.2.tar.gz

Now, copy over your configuration file:

cp vimbadmin-0.1.2/application/config/application.ini vimbadmin-0.2.2/application/config/application.ini

and ensure you make the changes to the config file as required below.
 
Ensure the var directory is set up correctly. E.g.

chown -R www-data: vimbadmin-0.2.2/var

And finally, change your symlink:

rm vimbadmin
ln -s vimbadmin-0.2.2 vimbadmin
